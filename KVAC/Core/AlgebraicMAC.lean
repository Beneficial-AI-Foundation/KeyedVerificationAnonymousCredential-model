# Algebraic message authentication codes (O24 Definition 3.1)

Defines the paper-level bundled object `AlgebraicMAC` per Orrù,
*Revisiting Keyed-Verification Anonymous Credentials*, IACR ePrint
2024/1552 Definition 3.1: an `AlgebraicMACSyntax ProbComp` paired with
a proof of correctness.

Re-exports `Construction.lean` (the syntactic structure) and
`Correctness.lean` (the correctness predicate) — i.e. what the bundle is
built from. The UF-CMVA security predicate (`Security.lean`) is *not*
re-exported because it is not part of the paper-level definition of an
algebraic MAC; files that reason about UF-CMVA security import
`KVAC.Core.AlgebraicMAC.Security` explicitly.

## Layering recap

```
                   AlgebraicMAC.lean (this file — bundle)
                           │
                ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                ▼                     ▼
        Construction.lean      Correctness.lean
                                      │
                                      └── (used by Correct predicate)

                   Security.lean (security predicate, opt-in)
                           │
                           └── imports Construction only
```

- `Construction.lean` — `AlgebraicMACSyntax M` (polymorphic over the
  randomness monad).
- `Correctness.lean` — `Correct (mac : AlgebraicMACSyntax ProbComp)`
  predicate, support-based.
- `Security.lean` — UF-CMVA game + advantage on
  `AlgebraicMACSyntax ProbComp`. Imported opt-in by files that need
  security reasoning, not transitively by this umbrella.
- This file — `AlgebraicMAC`, the bundled paper-level object.

The paper-level bundle commits to `M := ProbComp` because correctness
and security predicates are inherently distributional (free-monad
syntactic equality fails for `ProbComp`, so `Correct` cannot be stated
uniformly in `M`). The syntactic layer remains polymorphic to leave
room for future symbolic interpretations.
