# The UF-CMVA game of μCMZ with the oracle `Help` (O24 §5.2)

The unforgeability game of O24 Figure 5 for the base MAC of μCMZ, with the
oracle `Help(A₀, A⃗, Z)` of §5.2 (p. 35), which returns 1 if
`Z = (x₀ + xᵣ)•A₀ + Σᵢ xᵢ•Aᵢ` and 0 otherwise. The paper proves Theorem 5.1, in
the algebraic group model, for this game: "the scheme is unforgeable even if the
adversary is given one additional oracle Help". The proof of Theorem 5.10
(§5.5, p. 43) uses the answer of `Help` for its candidate `Z`.

The game is the honest one. The challenger holds the key and answers `Help` by
evaluating the equation, and no query carries an algebraic representation. The
instrumented game `AGM_UF_CMVAGame` of `AlgebraicMAC.lean` is the device of the
proof of Lemma 5.4, where the reduction answers `Help` from the representations
of an algebraic adversary (p. 38). Among the MAC results, the paper assumes the
algebraic group model in Theorem 5.1 and Lemma 5.4 only. The statement of Theorem
5.1 in `UFCMVA.lean`, `microCMZ_ufcmva_le_of_wellBehaved`, bounds the plain game
of Figure 5 for well-behaved algebraic adversaries. Their translation to the
plain game (`AGMBridge.lean`) answers `help` by `false`, and `WellBehaved`
forbids `Help` queries. A bound of Theorem 5.1 for this game, with `Help`
answered by the key, is open. Issue #235 proposes a transfer lemma onto it.

`Help` is specific to μCMZ, since its equation reads the key `(x₀, xᵣ, x⃗)`,
so the game is stated for `μCMZBaseMACSyntax` and not for the generic
`UF_CMVAGame` of `Core/AlgebraicMAC/Security.lean`. An adversary of that
generic game at μCMZ is an adversary of this game that never queries `Help`,
`ufAdversaryToHelp`, with the same advantage.

/-! ## The game -/

/-- An adversary of the UF-CMVA game with `Help` for μCMZ with `n` attributes.
Given the crs `H` and the public parameters `(X₀, Xᵣ, X⃗)`, it queries the three
oracles and outputs a forgery `(m⃗*, (U*, V*))`. It has a private coin oracle
`unifSpec` beside the game's oracles, as the one-more forgers do, so that a
reduction built from a sampling adversary, such as the `B` of Theorem 5.10, is
one inhabitant of this type. -/

/-- The UF-CMVA game with `Help` for μCMZ, O24 Figure 5 with the oracle of §5.2.
Setup and key generation are those of `μCMZBaseMACSyntax`. The private coin
oracle is answered in `ProbComp`. The adversary wins when its forged message is
fresh and its forgery verifies, as in `UF_CMVAGame`. -/

in Figure 5, without `Help`. Theorem 5.1 (p. 35) bounds the advantage with `Help`

an adversary of this game with the same advantage, so a bound on this game over
